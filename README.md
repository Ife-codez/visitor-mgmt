ABOUT THE SYSTEM:
it is a visitors management system designed for instant communication between VIPs and their secretary. the secretary sends visitor data through a form, and sends it to vip, the vip gets it instantly and as a system notification if they are not on the tab or window. the VIP can either approve or decline the request sent by their secretary by clicking on the buttons which will show a pop up for them to add any extra information. both users can view visitor history on their dashboard and clear it if they want.

REGISTRATION PROCESS:
VIP registers first, they are given an ID during registration, this id is used for communication between them and any secretary that uses the id during registration. (Choose Register As: VIP)
